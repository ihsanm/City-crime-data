# City Crime Data
## User story
As a user
* I want to find the crime data of my city or other cities. 
* I want to know the various types of crime  and the data through the chart
* I also want to  find the police information of the city.
* SO THAT I can find out about the safety of the city where I live or travel and etc.


## Our motivation for development

* We want to be able to view recent crime information for any given location in the UK as we feel this would be useful for anybody thinking of perhaps taking a city break in the UK, or is having to relocate for work etc. and would like to know which areas are the safest.
* We also felt that it is nice to know the levels and types of crime for the area in which you live. Could be the impetus for locking away you bike if bicycle theft is prevalent for example.
